- Function Interpolation and Approximation  
  - Lagrange interpolation, Newton’s divided difference formulas  
  - Error formulas  
  - Uniform and least squares approximation  
  - Cubic spline functions  

- Numerical Integration and Differentiation  
  - Composite methods (Newton-Cotes, Gauss)  
  - Error analysis  
  - Numerical differentiation and error formulas  
  - Application to partial differential equations (finite difference methods)  

- Numerical Solution of Differential Equations  
  - One-step methods (Euler, Crank-Nicholson, Runge-Kutta)
