   Simulation and Design Optimization of Wind Turbine Layouts
</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif;">
    Our current research on wind energy focuses on the numerical simulation of atmospheric and wind farm flowfields. We are investigating the effects of Reynolds number, blade geometry, array blockage, variable velocity control, and tip-speed ratio on cross-flow turbine hydrodynamics and performance. A key aspect of this work is linking the unsteady flow structures around each turbine blade to overall turbine performance, enabling better control strategies and design optimizations. By integrating high-fidelity simulations, advanced discretization methods, and data-driven approaches, we aim to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve the reliability of future wind energy systems.

   Turbulence and Shock Interactions in High-Speed Flows
</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif;">
    This research on high-speed flows focuses on the study of turbulence in compressible regimes, particularly shock-turbulence interactions. Compressible turbulence is characterized by fluctuations in thermodynamic variables, which evolve nonlinearly across a wide range of scales. We investigate how these fluctuations depend on compressibility levels, quantified by the turbulent Mach number, and explore their impact on velocity, density, pressure, and temperature statistics. Additionally, we conduct high-resolution simulations to analyze shock-turbulence interactions, where strong turbulence alters shock behavior beyond classical Rankine-Hugoniot relations. By leveraging massively parallel direct numerical simulations, we aim to improve the fundamental understanding of these interactions, with implications for aerodynamics, propulsion, and high-speed flight performance.

    Meso-Scale Fluidization and Particle-Laden Flows
</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif;">
    This research explores meso-scale fluidization phenomena in particle-laden turbulent flows using the LES-DEM approach. By coupling Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for fluid turbulence with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) for particle interactions, we aim to understand the dynamics of dispersed phases in complex flow environments. This work is particularly relevant to industrial and environmental applications, including pneumatic transport, energy systems, and geophysical flows. Our investigations focus on particle clustering, transport, and turbulence modulation, providing insights into how particles interact with fluid structures and influence overall flow behavior. Through high-fidelity simulations, we seek to enhance predictive models and improve the design of systems involving dense particle suspensions.

    High-Order Numerical Schemes for Conservation Laws
</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif;">
    This research focuses on developing high-order, robust shock-capturing numerical schemes that accurately resolve discontinuities while preserving flow structures. By leveraging advanced mathematical tools, we aim to enhance numerical stability and accuracy in complex flow simulations. A key application is the simulation of compressible flows in wind tunnels, where shock-wave interactions with solid boundaries create intricate flow patterns. The Euler equations, which govern compressible flows, are a system of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws (HCL) where mass, momentum, and energy are conserved. Our work focuses on designing shock-capturing schemes that maintain high accuracy in smooth regions while effectively handling shocks, improving simulations in high-speed aerodynamics, astrophysics, and reactive turbulence.
