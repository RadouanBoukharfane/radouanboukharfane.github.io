__Welcome to my web page__


<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
This site is pretty bare-bones right now, but hopefully over the next few years it will develop into something that is more useful. In the meantime, feel free to explore.

Hello! My name is Radouan Boukharfane, and I’m a  Research & Education Fellow at [Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P)](https://um6p.ma/), working in [The Modeling, Simulation and Data Analysis (MSDA)](https://msda.um6p.ma/home). Fefore joigning UM6P, I was for two years postdoctoral fellow in the [Extreme Computing Research Center (ECRC)](https://ecrc.kaust.edu.sa/), [Computer Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division (CEMSE)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/), KAUST (Thuwal, Saudi Arabia), hosted by [Matteo Parsani](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/matteo-parsani), and one year postdoctoral researcher at the [Aerodynamics, Energetics and Propulsion Department (DAEP)](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/research/departments/erodynamics-energetics-and-propulsion-department-daep-91/9aerodynamics-energetics-and-propulsion-department-daep/), [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/), Toulouse France.
I did my PhD at [P' Institute](https://www.pprime.fr) (Poiters, France) in the Fluids, Thermal Science and Combustion Department of [P' Institute](https://www.pprime.fr). I am holding two master degrees in Aerspace and Aeronautics engineeering in 2013 from [ISAE-SupAero](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) (Toulouse, France) after two years in preparatory class for MPSI/MP* grandes écoles, and in Advanced Numerical Methods applied on Fluid Dynamics from [Polytechnique de Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) (Montreal, Canada).
