OpenFOAM is a popular open source software package for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). It has a large user base across most areas of engineering and science, from both commercial and academic organisations. OpenFOAM has an extensive range of features to solve anything from complex fluid flows involving chemical reactions, turbulence and heat transfer, to acoustics, solid mechanics and electromagnetics. It is free-to-use numerical simulation software, including usage on HPC systems.
In this course you are going to learn how to simulate various flow configurations in the Computational Fluid Dynamics software OpenFOAM. This includes the simulation of laminar and turbulent, stationary and transient flows. Furthermore, you are going to see how to work with multiphase flows. We will cover how to choose correct initial and boundary conditions for the calculation. Moreover you will learn how to define a spatial domain and mesh it with a structured or unstructured grid. You are going to learn how to edit runtime controls and how to run a job including how to check convergence of the solution and visualize it graphically with ParaView.
