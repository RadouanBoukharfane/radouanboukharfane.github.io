<p align="justify" style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Times New Roman, sans-serif;">  
<b>FluidSim Lab</b> at the College of Computing, UM6P, develops and applies advanced computational tools to study complex, multi-scale, and multi-physics fluid dynamics. Our work focuses on turbulence, reactive flows, and multi-phase flows, with applications in clean energy, propulsion, and flight mechanics. We aim to improve scale-resolving simulations through high-order discretization methods for both structured and unstructured grids, implemented on massively parallel architectures for computational efficiency.

    This project focuses on the numerical simulation of atmospheric and wind farm flowfields. Through high-fidelity modeling and large-scale simulations, we aim to enhance our understanding of flow dynamics around wind turbines, optimizing their performance while ensuring reliability and cost-effectiveness. By integrating advanced computational methods, high-order discretization, and data-driven approaches, this project contributes to the development of more efficient wind energy systems, supporting sustainable energy solutions.

Hello! I’m Radouan Boukharfane, an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://um6p.ma/">Mohammed VI Polytechnic University (UM6P)</a>, affiliated with <a href="https://cc.um6p.ma/">The College of Computing</a>.  

Before joining UM6P, I was a postdoctoral fellow for two years at <a href="https://kaust.edu.sa/">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)</a> in <a href="https://ecrc.kaust.edu.sa/">the Extreme Computing Research Center (ECRC)</a>, followed by a one-year postdoctoral research position at <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/">ISAE-SUPAERO</a> (Toulouse, France) within <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/research/departments/erodynamics-energetics-and-propulsion-department-daep-91/9aerodynamics-energetics-and-propulsion-department-daep/">the Aerodynamics, Energetics, and Propulsion Department (DAEP)</a>.  

I earned my PhD at the <a href="https://www.pprime.fr">P' Institute</a>, specializing in Fluids, Thermal Science, and Combustion (<a href="https://pprime.fr/la-recherche/fluides-thermique-combustion/structures-de-flamme-et-combustion-ct/">FTC Department</a>). Prior to that, I obtained a double degree: a Master’s degree from <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/">Polytechnique Montréal</a> (Canada) and a Diplôme d’ingénieur from <a href="https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/">ISAE-SUPAERO</a> (France), following two years of preparatory classes in the MPSI/MP* track for French grandes écoles.
