All of our research projects fall in the category of computational science, which is the multi-disciplinary mix of applied math and numerical methods, programming for massively parallel supercomputing, and the physics of turbulence and fluid mechanics. 

Our overall vision is to bring high-fidelity turbulence simulations to the point where they can be routinely applied to real problems in engineering practice. This vision informs all of our work. In some projects we use supercomputing resources to learn more about turbulence physics, and we then try to take that knowledge to build new theoretical models that can be used to make predictions, build lower-cost models, and in general encode our understanding. In other projects we directly develop new algorithms or mathematical models, and then always with a mindfulness of how they would be used in practice.
