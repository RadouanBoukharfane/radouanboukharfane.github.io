GPUs are becoming more and more popular and nowadays they are widely available. During this course you will receive an introduction about numerical methods on GPU.

### Course contents

The course focuses on three main topics:

-	GPU architecture. The computing and memory systems of different commercial GPUs are introduced. A comparison with conventional CPU and presentation of new upcoming GPUs will be given.

-	GPU programming with CUDA. The CUDA concepts and how to use them to develop applications for GPU are introduced by making examples from different fields, such as image processing or scientific computing. Also development tools, such debuggers and performance monitoring tools are presented.

-	GPU programming with GPU libraries and frameworks. High-productivity computing frameworks, among which OpenACC, are presented. 

Students will be given access to the GPU cluster, Tegner, at PDC if they do not have access to a computer with GPU.

This short course is part of the program FIP (no idea what it stands for) proposed by *Arts et Métiers Institute of Technology*.

### Prerequisite
 
-	We are going to use the C/C++ language. Since programing GPU with CUDA is basically an extension of the C language, it is important that you refresh your C knowledge before starting the CUDA module of the course.

-	There are many online tutorials about C. Make sure that you know how to compile a C code from the command line, _i.e._, GCC, and write simple programs in C.
